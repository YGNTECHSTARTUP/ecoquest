## 🎯 Quest Generation & Management

### Quest Creation Pipeline
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[API Data Sources] --> B[Quest Engine]
    B --> C[User Profiling]
    C --> D[Difficulty Matching]
    D --> E[Quest Assignment]
    E --> F[Progress Tracking]
    F --> G[Completion Validation]
    G --> H[Reward Distribution]
```

### Quest Types & Triggers

#### 1. Weather-Based Quests
```javascript
// Weather Quest Generation Process
const weatherQuestFlow = {
  step1: "Fetch weather data every 6 hours",
  step2: "Analyze temperature, humidity, conditions",
  step3: "Match weather patterns to quest templates",
  step4: "Customize quest parameters for user",
  step5: "Schedule quest activation",
  step6: "Monitor completion via smart meters"
};

// Example Triggers:
triggers: {
  heatWave: "temp > 35°C → AC optimization quest",
  rainDay: "precipitation > 5mm → natural light quest",
  windyDay: "windSpeed > 20kmh → ventilation quest",
  coolMorning: "temp < 20°C → heating reduction quest"
}
```

#### 2. Grid Intelligence Quests
```javascript
// Grid-Based Quest Flow
const gridQuestFlow = {
  dataSource: "ElectricityMaps API",
  updateFrequency: "Hourly",
  questTypes: [
    "Low Carbon Hour → Charge devices",
    "High Demand Period → Reduce usage",
    "Renewable Peak → Run appliances",
    "Grid Stress → Emergency saving"
  ],
  validation: "Compare before/after usage patterns"
};
```

#### 3. Social Challenges
```javascript
// Social Quest Mechanics
const socialQuestFlow = {
  challengeCreation: {
    initiator: "User or System",
    participants: "Friends/Neighborhood/Global",
    duration: "24h, 1 week, 1 month",
    metrics: "Energy saved, Peak avoidance, Streak maintenance"
  },
  progressTracking: {
    realTimeUpdates: "Every 15 minutes",
    leaderboardRefresh: "Every hour",
    notifications: "Position changes, milestones"
  }
};
```

### Quest Lifecycle Management
```
Quest Created → User Assigned → Progress Tracked → Completion Checked → Rewards Given → Analysis Stored
```

**Detailed Quest States:**
- **PENDING**: Quest created, waiting for user action
- **ACTIVE**: User accepted, tracking in progress
- **PAUSED**: User requested pause (premium feature)
- **COMPLETED**: Successfully finished within deadline
- **FAILED**: Deadline passed without completion
- **EXPIRED**: Quest became irrelevant (weather changed)

    analysis: "Real-time pattern detection"
  }
};
```

### Data Collection Pipeline
```
Meter Reading → Data Validation → Format Normalization → Database Storage → Real-time Processing → User Interface Update
```

**Data Flow Stages:**
1. **Collection**: Every 30 seconds from connected meters
2. **Validation**: Check for anomalies and missing data
3. **Processing**: Calculate derivatives (cost, trends, predictions)
4. **Storage**: Time-series database with compression
5. **Distribution**: Real-time updates to user interfaces
