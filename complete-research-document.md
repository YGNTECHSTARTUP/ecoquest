### Behavioral Psychology Principles

#### 1. Operant Conditioning
- **Variable Ratio Reinforcement**: Random bonus points for engagement
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time points and progress updates
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Rewards for desired behaviors
- **Extinction Prevention**: Varied reward types to prevent habituation

#### 2. Self-Determination Theory
- **Autonomy**: Users choose their challenges and goals
- **Competence**: Progressive difficulty with achievable milestones
- **Relatedness**: Social features create community connections

#### 3. Social Proof & Competition
- **Descriptive Norms**: "Your neighbors save X% more energy"
- **Injunctive Norms**: "Top performers in your area do this"
- **Social Comparison**: Leaderboards and peer rankings
- **Group Identity**: Team challenges and community pride

#### 4. Loss Aversion & Endowment Effect
- **Streak Preservation**: Fear of losing consecutive day streaks
- **Status Protection**: Maintain leaderboard positions
- **Badge Collection**: Don't want to be the only one without achievements
- **Social Standing**: Reputation among friends and community

### Quest Design Framework

#### Dynamic Quest Generation Algorithm
```javascript
const questGeneration = {
  weatherBased: {
    heatWave: {
      trigger: "temperature > 35°C",
      quest: "Set AC to 26°C+ for 4 hours",
      points: 150,
      multiplier: "1.5x if temperature > 40°C"
    },
    monsoon: {
      trigger: "rain > 10mm forecast",
      quest: "Use natural light during day",
      points: 100,
      multiplier: "2.0x if all-day rain"
    }
  },
  
  gridBased: {
    lowCarbon: {
      trigger: "renewable energy > 60%",
      quest: "Charge devices now",
      points: 120,
      urgency: "2-hour window"
    },
