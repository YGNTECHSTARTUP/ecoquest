```javascript
const firebaseLimitations = {
  firestoreReads: {
    freeLimit: "50,000 reads/day",
    realNeed: "200,000+ reads/day with 1000+ active users",
    cost: "‚Çπ40,000+/month when exceeded",
    impact: "Sudden cost spike or service degradation"
  },
  
  cloudFunctions: {
    freeLimit: "2M invocations/month",

## üé≠ The Brutal Truth

**This is a HIGH-RISK, HIGH-REWARD venture with significant challenges:**

### Major Cons Summary:
1. **Technical complexity** far exceeds initial estimates
2. **Business model assumptions** likely too optimistic  
3. **Market timing** may be 2-3 years too early
4. **Competition** from well-funded incumbents
5. **User behavior change** harder than gamification suggests
6. **Environmental impact** measurement prone to errors
7. **Infrastructure costs** can spiral quickly

### Why It Might Still Work:
1. **Market need** is genuine and growing
2. **Technology trends** favor the solution
3. **Government support** for smart grid initiatives
4. **First-mover advantage** in gamified energy space
5. **Climate urgency** creating user motivation
6. **Network effects** can create strong moats

**Recommendation**: Proceed with **cautious optimism** and **realistic expectations**. Start with a smaller scope, validate assumptions quickly, and be prepared to pivot or shut down if key metrics don't hit targets.

The cons are real and significant, but the potential impact makes it worth a calculated risk. üé≤‚ö°üåç
